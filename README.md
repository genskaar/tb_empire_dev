# Interactive ROTE TB Map
## About
This tool is designed for helping guilds achieve their maximum potential
in the rise of the empire territory battle in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.

The tool is created from and improves upon the interactive map for rise of the empire TB,
hosted at ```https://github.com/genskaar/tb_empire``` and available to use at
```https://genskaar.github.io/tb_empire/```. This was originally adapted from a 
design by github user jetkokos, who left the community a while ago but we 
retain the licence set out in that repository ```https://github.com/jetkokos/tb_geo/blob/master/LICENSE.```


To view the map, simply open the index.html file in your favourite
web browser. Alternatively visit: 

```https://genskaar.github.io/tb_empire/``` 

## Suggestions
Squad suggestions are an important part of keeping the map up to date and usable. 
A squad suggestion form and or discord server will be set up in the future.
